   <h3 className="darkbodystyle">Averhealth's initiatives in patient engagement offered an opportunity to work on designs for an Anroid/iOS mobile application 
   aimed at harnessing laboratory data to generate risk scores and enable contingency management. Development is ongoing. <br /><br />Outside of native applications, 
   I also designed a single-page web application accessed via short link and QR code to drive enrollment in the company's SMS notification campaign. The percentage of 
   enrolled patients doubled within one month after deployment, with over 14,000 sessions to date. </h3>

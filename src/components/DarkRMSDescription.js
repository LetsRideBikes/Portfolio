   <h3 className="darkbodystyle">Navigator was a product designed to help recovery professionals and therapists manage the diverse needs of their client population. I lead my team in developing user personas, then interviewing doctors, behavioral health specialists, recovery coaches and treatment professionals to discover the most valuable opportunities to address their needs. Design challenges included finding ways to codify qualitative properties about human interaction into searchable content, provide individual and population level data in a shared space, and meet the needs of many different professional styles while maintaining a consistent user experience.

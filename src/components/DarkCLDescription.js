   <h3 className="darkbodystyle">Color Line provided a unique solution for healthcare professionals that needed to navigate complex CMS regulations for 
   laboratory ordering within the context of periodic toxicology tests. Color Line organized, maintained and scheduled random scheduling for any permutation 
   of frequencies and lab orders, while satisfying payer requirements for medical necessity. Furthermore, the application provided treatment professionals with 
   scheduled and on-demand reporting, dashboards and tools for managing protocols and events. Color Line was also fully integratable to LIMS using HL7 or FHIR APIs.<br/><br/> Color Line began development through a small local development firm, and with it's success in dozens of practices in New England, Texas and Colorado, grew to be under the control of our in-house engineering team. Color Line became a strategic differentiator for Aspenti Health, allowing it to reach new markets outside of it's core business model. </h3>

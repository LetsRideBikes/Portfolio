   <h3 className="darkbodystyle">Averhealth is a toxicology laboratory with specimen collection centers nationwide. Many of these collection centers see very little volume in a day, 
   yet require trained staff during all business hours to accommodate unpredictable timing of collections. This creates significant waste and inefficiency. 
   Enter Averview, a program designed to facilitate remote specimen collection via telemedicine. Averview ingests scheduled appointments for patients and allows 
   centralized collectors to see, hear and instruct patients through their collection. This procedure also results in a more comfortable encounter for the patient, 
   who can opt to turn off their view of the collector. Audio recordings reduce the instances of tampering by hearsay, increasing the integrity of the collection 
   procedure. Averview is currently under development and is planned to have a substantial impact on overhead costs when deployed.</h3>
